# contacts
Vue.js contacts list app

This app pulls a list of contacts from an API, displaying each contact's properties (name, email, phone, ID, favorite contact (true or false) and also allows you to add your own contact.

Note: If browser does not display contacts, allow it to load unsafe scripts (github uses https, while the api uses http).
